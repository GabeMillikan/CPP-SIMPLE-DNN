# CPP-SIMPLE-DNN
A simple implementation of a deep neural netowrk in C++. The purpose of this project is to represent the processes of a deep neural network as simply as possible. Layers and neurons are represented explicity in their own classes, which results in slower training times. 

Variable names and algorithms in the code are pulled directly from [DNN_Math.pdf](https://github.com/GabeMillikan/CPP-SIMPLE-DNN/blob/main/DNN_Math.pdf) in this project, so please reference that file while reading the code.

This is a precursor to my other project [CUDA-FAST-DNN](https://github.com/GabeMillikan/CUDA-FAST-DNN) which takes advantage of GPU hardware acceleration (and more efficient algorithms) to vastly speed up the training process.
